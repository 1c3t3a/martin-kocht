      <title>Asparagus Asian style</title>

      <description>Profile This is a good change to the traditional German style asparagus. In Germany, typically white asparagus is eaten, while elsewhere it is more likely to eat green asparagus. This asparagus is roasted and gives a splendid combination with the sharp chili and the sesame oil. If you don’t like green asparagus or can’t get white asparagus just use the color you like and can get.
You can get good asparagus from April to June on the weekly market in Gröbenzell (every Friday morning).</description>

      <description>Profile I enjoyed this squid while traveling to Taiwan some weeks ago. That was on the night market in Kenting, in the very south of Taiwan:

The sauce is a trial to redo it. Maybe someone correct it in the comments. In such case: thank you very much.
Of course the squid is from Antonio:

      <description>Profile This is a recipe from a book that has been modified slightly. The author is as me a fan of Monty Python. You may add a special taste by the Thai Sauce. Together with the oven vegetables and rice you have a perfect and delicious menu in less than an hour.
Ingredients  600g chicken breast 1 spoon flour 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika powder 1/2 teaspoon galangal powder (if you don’t have that use a bit more of the curry powder) 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 spoon curry powder 2 onions a bit ginger 500ml vegetable soup (instant) 1 glas mango chutney Creme Fraiche Butter  Let&amp;rsquo;s go Cut the onions pretty fine and chop the ginger:</description>

      <description>Profile Simple food with only the fish as an imporant ingredient. It should come from the fishmonger of your trust. You can prepare this dish in minutes and it’s perfect as a starter.
I get my fish from Antonio having a seperate business in the Tutti Gusto in Gröbenzell. He always sells different fish in Sushi quality. You will find the Tutti Gusto here:
