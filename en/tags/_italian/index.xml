      <description>Profile Sometimes you do not have much time to cook, like me currently. Than it’s nice to prepare a quick dish that is deliciuous. This one takes about 15 minutes and is also simple.
Typically I add 4-5 olives but today I forgot to buy them. You can use any kind of fish, just one small piece is enough. I get the fish from Antonio and you can find him here:</description>

      <description>Profile We all know the things we liked at home as kids and that we still love today. These Spaghetti are such a recipe that I still cook frequently and that we all love a lot. If it is too much you can keep the sauce for the next day and warm it up without loosing the great taste. You may also keep it in the freezer for some time.</description>

      <description>Profile Tills favorite spaghetti. Re-cooked from the Poseidon at the Viktualienmarkt in Munich.
The Poseidon is actually a fishmonger which offers some places for lunch. However it’s pretty crowded and especially during the summer it’s difficult to get one of the rare seats outside. But it is worth to wait, for example for a fantastic fish soup. The Poseidon can be found here:

      <description>Profile This is one of my self invented recipes. Many people don’t like liver, but for those who like it it’s a nice alternative to the usual preparation.
You can use the same sauce (a glass of each balsamico, red wine and water) also for steaks. Refer to this recipe: Steaks with mushrooms in balsamico.
Ingredients  Chicken liver (or if you can’t get it, turkey liver), 200g per person 1-2 onions sliced in rings Garlic Flour Half a glass of balsamico 1 -1,5 teaspoon of sugar Olive oil Baguette  Let&amp;rsquo;s go Prepare the corn salad using your preferred dressing.</description>

      <description>Profile The spinach is the most important in this recipe. It took some iterations to find out that spinach is the thing to be added to provide the special taste in combination with the salmon. Give it a try if you like salmon pasta, you will not be disappointed.
Ingredients  1 onion Garlic 5-6 cherry tomatoes Spring onions Spinach according to your wishes. Some handful is typically enough Salmon fillet (200-250g per person) 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon vegetable broth 1 can Creme Fine or Creme Fraiche Olive oil Fish sauce or oyster sauce (Asia market).</description>

      <title>Steaks with mushrooms in balsamico with gnocchi</title>

      <description>Profile The quality of the steaks are the most important ingredient in this recipe. It’s best to cut them freshly from a whole Roastbeef and to cook them not too cold but at room temperature. The sauce can be used for other dishes such as the chicken liver salad given here Salad with chicken liver.
You can use the same sauce for a nice salad such as this one: Corn salad with chicken liver in balsamico.</description>
