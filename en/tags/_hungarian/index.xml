      <description>Profile This is a completely unhealthy dish. Except onions there are no vegetables, just pure meat in a sauce. Typical man food that my mom made sometimes on Saturday evenings when I was a small boy. As I like it so much I started preparing this and modified it a bit. Here is my version of the Hungarian dish.
The original recipe uses different innards such as liver and kidney but I prefer it best with beef.</description>
